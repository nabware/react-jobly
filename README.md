### Frontend Deployment: 
We used Surge to deploy our front end. 

First make sure Surge is installed: 

    npm install -g surge

Next, letâ€™s make sure we define the environment variable for our frontend app.

    REACT_APP_BASE_URL=YOUR_RENDER_BACKEND_URL npm run build

Now build your frontend.
    
    cp build/index.html build/200.html
    surge build
